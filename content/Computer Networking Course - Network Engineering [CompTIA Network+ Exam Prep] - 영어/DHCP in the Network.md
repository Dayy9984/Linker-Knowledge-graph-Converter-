- DHCP automates the assignment of IP addresses and network configuration details to devices on a network.
- Dynamic IP addressing via DHCP is scalable and less error-prone than static IP addressing, especially as a network grows.

- DHCP Process:
  - A client sends a discovery packet upon boot-up to acquire an IP configuration.
  - DHCP servers listen on port 67 and respond with an offer packet.
  - Clients reply with a request packet, and the DHCP server sends back an acknowledgment with the necessary IP configuration.
